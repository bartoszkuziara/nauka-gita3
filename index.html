	<p>I found a love for me
Darling just dive right in, and follow my lead
I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
I never knew you were the someone waiting for me</p>
	<p>Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was, I will not give you up this time
But darling just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes youâ€™re holding mine
	</p>
