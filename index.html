	<h1>Ed Sheeran</h1>
	<p>I found a love for me
Darling just dive right in, and follow my lead
I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
I never knew you were the someone waiting for me</p>
	<p>Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was, I will not give you up this time
But darling just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes you’re holding mine
	</p>
	<p>Baby I’m dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling you look perfect tonight</p>
